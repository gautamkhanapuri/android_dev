// Invocations of independent functions doSomethingUsefulOne and doSomethingUsefulTwo

// async is like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread
//   that works concurrently with all the other coroutines. The difference is that launch
//   returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns
//   a Deferred â€” a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide
//   a result later. The method .await() can be called on a deferred value to get its
//   eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so if can be cancelled if required.

// The Concurrency async example can be combined into a function that runs d
//   oSomethingUsefulOne and doSomethingUsefulTwo concurrently and returns their combined
//   results. Since async is a CoroutineScope extension, using the coroutineScope function to
//   provide the necessary scope
// This way, if something goes wrong inside the code of the concurrentSum function, and it
//   throws an exception, all the coroutines that were launched in its scope will be cancelled.
